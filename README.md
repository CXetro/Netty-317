Netty-317
=========
Netty #317 is a custom framework made by Michael P using the Netty libary. As much as I wish that this will exterminate the use of PI, I know it will not so I will not set that as my goal, as many people do when they make frameworks. With that said, let's get away from that. My overall goal with this framework is to just provide a clean, yet stable framework. This will NOT have much content. So, if that's what you're looking for, Netty #317 is not for you.
